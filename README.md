# Shap-Shap

## Project Description
Shap-Shap is my personal python project that tries to do SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis for any machine learning models and any dataset. SHAP is a powerful technique for explaining the output of machine learning models by attributing the prediction to individual input features. This project provides a user-friendly interface to perform SHAP analysis on your models and data.
